This files provides a couple of functions `apply-interactive' and `ido-choose-function'
which you might find useful in your code.

 - `apply-interactive' can be used to partially apply arguments to functions, like `apply-partially',
   except that the curried arguments are obtained interactively using the `interactive'
   form of the function. 
 - `ido-choose-function' can be used to prompt the user for a function (e.g. for filtering items),
   and some of it's arguments.

* Installation

Put ido-choose-function.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'ido-choose-function)
